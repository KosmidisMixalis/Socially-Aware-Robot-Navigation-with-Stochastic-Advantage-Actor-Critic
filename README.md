## Overview

This repository contains the full implementation and resources for the paper:

**"Socially-Aware Navigation via Stochastic Advantage Actor-Critic for Continuous Action Control in POMDPs"**

The project integrates reinforcement learning, social force modeling, and ROS-based navigation for a mobile robot operating in human-populated environments.  
Our method builds upon the Ridgeback platform and utilizes a stochastic A2C algorithm to learn continuous action control under partial observability.
